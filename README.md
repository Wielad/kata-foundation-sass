# Kata: Foundation & Sass

## Getting started
If you want to see working app simply open file *dist/index.html*.

If you want to explore the code, you can find in *app* folder.

## Fireworks (what to look at to experience the magic)
List of technologies used in the task:
- [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) - to make the html structure done right
- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) - to maintain the CSS consistency
- [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) - to keep the nice look of icons
And in background:
- [Node](http://nodejs.org/) - to serve documents to the browser
- [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) - to bootstrap the project
- [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) - to speed up repeatitive tasks like Sass compilation

This pretty simple task is totally responsive. 
Plain input validation is also included if you press the red button.
Compatibility: >= IE9 (and Firefox, Chrome, Opera and Safari obviously)

If you want to explore the code:
 - Whole HTML structure is done in *index.html*
 - CSS is split among two mainly two files: *app/scss/_settings.scss* and *app/css/app_override.css*
 - very little validation adaptation is done via JS in *app/js/app.js*
